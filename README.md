# SELD-TCN: Sound Event Localization and Detection via Temporal Convolutional Networks

The SELD-TCN was originally proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01609.

This repository contains a SELD-TCN implementation. The implementation is discussed in 'SELD-TCN_implementation_report.pdf'.

SELDnet implementation (https://github.com/sharathadavanne/seld-net.git) has been used as a starting point for the development of this network.
